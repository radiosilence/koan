# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Cover art in Now Playing** — macOS Control Center shows embedded album art (extracted to temp file, passed as file:// URL to souvlaki)
- **Seek from Control Center** — absolute position, relative with duration, and direction-only (10s steps)
- **Quit from Control Center** — clean shutdown via atomic flag on SharedPlayerState

### Fixed

- **mise binary name** — release tarballs now contain `koan` instead of `koan-macos-arm64`, fixing mise installs

### Removed

- **Dead file watcher** — notify/FSEvents module was implemented but never wired in. Removed watcher.rs, notify deps, `config.watch` field

## 0.2.0

First public release. Full TUI rewrite, undo/redo, file organization, CI/CD pipeline.

### Added

- **Ratatui TUI** — full-screen terminal UI with transport bar (click-to-seek), album-grouped queue, fuzzy picker overlay, library browser, track info modal with embedded album art (halfblock rendering), scrollbar, mouse support throughout
- **Undo/redo** — 100-deep undo stack covering all playlist operations (add, remove, move, clear). `Ctrl+Z` to undo, `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` to redo. Batch operations (multi-delete, multi-move) undo as a single step
- **File organization** — in-TUI organize modal: select tracks in edit mode → `Space` → Organize → pick a named pattern → preview → execute. Playlist paths update live, playback continues uninterrupted. Ancillary files move with the music
- **Format string engine** — fb2k-compatible title formatting: `%field%` references, `[conditional]` blocks, `$function(args)` calls. 30+ built-in functions (string, logic, numeric, path). 234 tests
- **Named organize patterns** — define reusable patterns in config (`[organize.patterns]`), set a default, pick from them in the TUI modal
- **Context menu** — `Space` in edit mode opens action overlay (currently: Organize)
- **Drag/drop** — drag files or folders from Finder into the terminal to add to the queue (bracketed paste)
- **Queue editing** — edit mode (`e`) with Finder-style multi-selection (shift-arrows, option-click toggle, ctrl-click range), reorder (`j`/`k`), delete (`d`), multi-drag
- **Library browser** — split-pane tree view (artists → albums → tracks), substring filter (`f`/`/`), click/double-click support
- **Picker actions** — `Enter` appends, `Ctrl+Enter` appends and plays, `Ctrl+R` replaces entire queue
- **Mouse support** — double-click to play, click-to-seek, drag-to-reorder, scrollbar drag, scroll wheel, picker click/dismiss — works in every mode
- **Priority play** — double-click a downloading track to play it as soon as it finishes
- **Media keys** — macOS Control Center integration via souvlaki (play/pause, next/prev, now playing info)
- **Track info modal** — `i` shows full metadata + audio format details + embedded album art
- **Cover art zoom** — `z` for full-screen album art (halfblock rendering)
- **Dynamic shell completions** — `source <(COMPLETE=zsh koan)` for artist/album ID tab-completion from the DB
- **Parallel remote sync** — album detail fetches parallelized with rayon, batch DB writes per page
- **`koan init`** — scaffolds `~/.config/koan/` with config templates (organize patterns, playback defaults, library paths), database, cache dir, and `.gitignore` for dotfile repos
- **`koan pick`** — in-process fuzzy picker powered by nucleo (replaces fzf dependency). `--album`/`--artist` modes with drill-down
- **CI/CD pipeline** — test + clippy + fmt check, cross-compiled binaries (arm64 + x86_64), GitHub releases with auto-tagging, crates.io publishing (`koan-core` then `koan-music`)
- **MIT LICENSE** file

### Fixed

- **Album picker adds wrong tracks** — was passing album IDs as track IDs, now correctly expands via DB query
- **Track artist vs album artist** — stored separately in DB, compilations display correctly
- **Seek past end of track** — skips to next instead of crashing
- **Scroll past end** — queue scroll clamps correctly
- **Scroll in modals** — routes to active modal instead of always scrolling queue
- **Library shows album artists only** — no spurious entries from featured artists on compilations
- **Crash on pick subcommand** — fixed usize underflow race with `saturating_sub`, added panic hook for terminal restore
- **Queue metadata for local tracks** — was blank, now populated correctly
- **Album header dimming** — only dims when ALL tracks in group are played

### Changed

- **Crate renamed** — `koan-cli` → `koan-music` (binary stays `koan`), directory `crates/koan-music/`
- **Config path** — `~/.config/koan/` (was `~/Library/Application Support/koan/`)
- **Two-layer config** — `config.toml` (committable) + `config.local.toml` (gitignored)
- **Password storage** — stored in `config.local.toml` via `koan remote login`, not macOS Keychain

### Removed

- **`koan organize` CLI subcommand** — file organization is now TUI-only (context menu → organize modal)
- **FFI/Swift layer** — removed entirely, pure Rust
- **fzf dependency** — replaced with built-in nucleo fuzzy picker
